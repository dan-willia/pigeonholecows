The cow example is an illustration of the pigeonhole principle. If we have five cows in a square pen with side length d, the two nearest cows can be no more than d/sqrt(2) units apart. In other words, there is always at least one cow within d/sqrt(2) units from another. 

In this visualization, the cows are colored circles. There is a line drawn from each "cow" to its nearest neighbor, with the distance displayed halfway between them. The nearest two cows' line is in red. This distance will never exceed d/sqrt(2). The largest this distance has gotten in the current visualization is shown at the top as "max min". The "max possible min" is 600/sqrt(2) = 424.26.
